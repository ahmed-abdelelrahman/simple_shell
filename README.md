# Description
Project is done by  [**Mina Robir**](https://github.com/minarob23) and [**Ahmed Abdelrahman**](https://github.com/ahmed-abdelelrahman)

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General
* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of main
* How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the execve system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is EOF / “end-of-file”?
# Requirements
#  General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
Your shell should not have any memory leaks
No more than 5 functions per file
All your header files should be include guarded
Use system calls only when you need to
## Features
* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* Hndling the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
* Hanling the command line with arguments
* Handle the PATH
* Support the exit features and the exit status
* Handle the Ctrl-C to not terminate the shell
* Handling the command seperator `;`
* Handling `&&` and `||` logical operators
* Handle variable replacements `$?` and `$$`
* Handle the comments `#`
* Support the history feature
* Support the file input

# | Files - Definition
- README.md - description about the project repo
- man_1_simple_shell - is the man page for the shell we are going to write.
- AUTHORS - file at the  root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. 
- main.h - is the header file which contains the standared header file and prototype of o function used in the program.
- main.c - initialize the program with infinite loop by call the prompt function
- prompt.c - it use getline system call to read the input from the user and run infinite loop with fork to keep prompt going.
- special_character - It identiies if the special inputs such as if the frist input is slash,the user typed exit or env...
- string.c -it handles the strings(string length, write string,find string in directory,concatane strings....)
- cmd.c - it finds the command the user entered.
- execute.c - execute the command.

 ## Installation : Getting HSH
 
Clone the below repository and compile the files into an executable using the GCC compiler.
```
https://github.com/ahmed-abdelelrahman/simple_shell.git
```

### Basic usage :bulb:
- First, Fork this Repository [Learn how to fork repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).
- Then Clone [Learn how to clone ](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Create an executable by running the following command:
- `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`
- From there, type in the following command and press your enter button.
- `./hsh`
- Final step: ENJOY!

## How to add Author file
`Bash script for generating the list of authors in git repo`
```
#!/bin/sh

git shortlog -se \
  | perl -spe 's/^\s+\d+\s+//' \
  | sed -e '/^CommitSyncScript.*$/d' \
  > AUTHORS
  ```
